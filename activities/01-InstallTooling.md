# Install .NET SDK

## What's the plan?

We're going make sure the correct version of the SDK for .NET Core is installed and if not, install it.

## Activity Steps

1. Verify the .NET SDK version installed on your PC. Open a command prompt and run the following command...

```dotnet --version```

The version should be **2.1.403** or higher.

2. If you require a newer version, you can download and install it from [.NET SDK for Visual Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/visual-studio-sdks)

3. You can view additional information with the following command...

```dotnet --info```

This command lists all of the SDK and runtime versions installed on your PC.
